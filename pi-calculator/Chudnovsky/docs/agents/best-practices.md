# Best Practices

This document outlines general coding best practices that apply across all policy categories.

## Core Best Practices

1. **Performance First**: Always consider parallelization opportunities
2. **Code Organization**: Keep files small and focused
3. **Reusability**: Design components to be reusable
4. **Testability**: Write testable, modular code
5. **Documentation**: Document public APIs and complex logic
6. **Error Handling**: Handle errors explicitly and gracefully
7. **Security**: Always validate input, check bounds, and protect against common vulnerabilities

## General Principles

- These guidelines should be followed whenever practical
- Some exceptions may be necessary for specific use cases
- Always prioritize correctness over performance optimizations
- Profile and measure before optimizing
