# Finish project on HSC Vectors

Folder: `/HSC-Vectors/`
Sample problems: 
- `/HSC-Vectors/samples/*.tex`

The objective of this project is to create a collection of HSC Math Extension 2 problems that are relevant to vectors. The problems should be suitable for HSC students.

Folder structure of this project (`/HSC-Vectors/`) is similar to `/HSC-Induction/`. E.g.
- Makefile 
- HSC-Vectors.tex
- samples/
- problems/
- solutions/
- styles/: use the same styles as `/HSC-Induction/styles/`
- releases/
- README.md
- .gitignore

The content of the file `HSC-Vectors.tex` is as follows:

- Intro to this project
 Brief review of vectors fundamentals. Pls refer to `HSC-Vectors/samples/00-basic.tex` to cover basic vectors.
 Key theorems/formulas students should know (vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, etc.)
 Notation and conventions used in this project.


`README.md` should contain the following sections:
- Introduction
- What this project is about, the audience it is for
- How to build this project
- Conclusion & good luck!

# Key Vectors Topics 

HSC Extension 2 questions on Vectors typically cover the following topics:

- Vector representation in 2D and 3D coordinates
- Vector addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication
- Vector equations of lines and planes
- Dot product and its applications (angles and orthogonality)
- Parametric and vector forms of line equations
- Use of vectors in geometric proofs and problem solving
- Midpoints, ratios, and division of line segments
- Calculating angles between vectors using dot product
- Calculating shortest distances from points to lines or planes
- Application of vectors in mechanics and calculus contexts

# Target audience: 

Students who are preparing for HSC Math Extension 2 who want to challenge themselves with difficult problems and develop advanced problem-solving skills using vectors.

Part 1: Problems and Solutions (Detailed solutions)
- (easy problems) Basic vector problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- (medium problems) Medium vector problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- (hard problems) Advanced vector problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
(Do not show Hints for problems in Part 1, just state the problems and show the solutions.)
So, that Part 1 has 3x5 = 15 problems.

Part 2: Problems and Solutions (less detailed solutions)
- (easy problems) Basic vector problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
- (medium problems) Medium vector problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
- (hard problems) Advanced vector problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
For problems in Part 2, show Hints for problems.
- Conclusion & good luck!

Part 1 and Part 2 aim for roughly equal distribution across difficulty levels.

Note:
- We have about 33 sample problems in the folder `samples/`. You can pick any 3x5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- And you pick the rest of the problems and solve them (less detailed solutions).
- Make sure no problem is repeated in Part 1 and Part 2.

The structure (Sections) of the file `README.md` is similar to `/HSC-Induction/README.md` but about this project.

Difficulty criteria for easy/medium/hard classifications:
- Easy: Direct application of formulas (vector addition, dot product, etc.)
- Medium: Multi-step problems combining 2-3 concepts
- Hard: Problems requiring creative approaches, proofs, or multiple complex techniques
