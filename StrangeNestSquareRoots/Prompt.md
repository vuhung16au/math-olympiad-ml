# Implement a Python script 

The purpose of the script to simulate the density of the sequence generated by the recurrence relation $x_{k+1} = 2x_k\sqrt{1 - x_k^2}$ with initial condition $x_0 \in [0,1]$.

Let's start with the simplest case: $x_0 = 3/4$.

The script: 
- StrangeNestSquareRoots.py



This script/simulation will help me answer the question: 
- How dense the sequence is?
- How does the density change as the initial condition changes?

Output file: 
tmp/StrangeNestSquareRoots/density_0.5.txt

Base on the output file, plot the density of the sequence.
Illustrate the density of the sequence in a figure and include it in .tex file.

This scriprt runs on a virtual environment:
- .venv/ for the virtual environment
- Python 3.9
- numpy
- matplotlib

Update `README.md` to write the instructions for the script (setup virtual environment, run the script, and view the output).

# Help me create a LaTeX version for the small project "StrangeNestSquareRoots" 

You should produce the files 
- StrangeNestSquareRoots.tex
- StrangeNestSquareRoots.pdf
- Makefile
- .gitignore: for the Latex project 

Makefile rules:
- all, pdf: StrangeNestSquareRoots.pdf
- release: cp StrangeNestSquareRoots.pdf release/StrangeNestSquareRoots.pdf
- view: open StrangeNestSquareRoots.pdf
- clean: rm -f StrangeNestSquareRoots.pdf
- StrangeNestSquareRoots.pdf: StrangeNestSquareRoots.tex
- StrangeNestSquareRoots.tex: StrangeNestSquareRoots.md

File `StrangeNestSquareRoots.tex` should be the main file for the LaTeX project. It should include the following sections:
- Introduction
- The Problem
- The sequence 345
- The invariant measure
- The dyadic map
- The ergodic theorem
- Conclusion: how it is related machine learning and AI?

You should use the following files as a reference:
Under folder tmp/StrangeNestSquareRoots:
- TheProblem.md
- Sequence_345.md
- InvariantMeasure.md
- DyadicMap.md
- ErgodicTheorem.md

Additional requirements:
- make sure the Makefile is correct and works for all the rules
