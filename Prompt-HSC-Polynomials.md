Folder: `/HSC-Polynomials/`
Sample problems: 
- `/HSC-Polynomials/samples/*.tex`
The objective of this project is to create a collection of HSC Math Extension 2 problems that are relevant to polynomials. The problems should be suitable for HSC students.

Folder structure of this project (`/HSC-Polynomials/`) is similar to `/HSC-Induction/`. E.g.
- Makefile 
- HSC-Polynomials.tex
- samples/
- problems/
- solutions/
- styles/: use the same styles as `/HSC-Induction/styles/`
- releases/
- README.md
- .gitignore 
- `PROBLEM_CLASSIFICATION.md`: similar to `/HSC-Integrals/PROBLEM_CLASSIFICATION.md`, but for polynomials problems.
- `SELECTION_SUMMARY.md`: similar to `/HSC-Integrals/SELECTION_SUMMARY.md`, but for polynomials problems.

The content of the file `HSC-Polynomials.tex` is as follows:
- Intro to this project
 Brief review of proofs fundamentals. Pls refer to `HSC-Polynomials/samples/00-basic.tex` to cover basic polynomials.
 Key theorems/formulas students should know (e.g.: Remainder Theorem, Factor Theorem, etc.)
 Notation and conventions used in this project.


`README.md` should contain the following sections:
- Introduction (use `samples/00-basic.tex` to cover basic polynomials)
- What this project is about, the audience it is for
- How to build this project
- Conclusion & good luck!
- Contact information

# Key Polynomials Topics 

HSC Math Extension 2 questions on Polynomials typically cover the following topics:

- Factoring Polynomials
- Roots of Polynomials
- Vieta's Formulas (Viète's Theorem) (advanced, not explicitly listed in HSC syllabus but useful, it shows relationships between the roots and coefficients of polynomials, required knowledge for the HSC Extension 2 exam (advanced).
- Complex Numbers
- Transformations of Roots
- Nature of Roots
- Polynomials and Trigonometric Identities

# Target audience: 

Students who are preparing for HSC Math Extension 2 who want to challenge themselves with difficult problems and develop advanced problem-solving skills using Polynomials.
Part 1: Problems and Solutions (Detailed solutions)
- (easy problems) Basic Polynomials problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- (medium problems) Medium Polynomials problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- (hard problems) Advanced Polynomials problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
(Do not show Hints for problems in Part 1, just state the problems and show the solutions.)
So, that Part 1 has 3x5 = 15 problems.

Part 2: Problems and Solutions (less detailed solutions)
- (easy problems) Basic Polynomials problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
- (medium problems) Medium Polynomials problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
- (hard problems) Advanced Polynomials problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
For problems in Part 2, show Hints for problems.
- Conclusion & good luck!

Part 1 and Part 2 aim for roughly equal distribution across difficulty levels (but not strictly necessary).

Notes:
- We have about +30 sample problems in the folder `samples/` (from 01 to 38). You can pick any 3x5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- And you pick the rest of the problems and solve them (less detailed solutions).
- Make sure no problem is repeated in Part 1 and Part 2.
- A problem in a file `samples/XX.tex` can have multiple sub-questions (a), (b), (c), etc. You can choose to include all sub-questions and solutions included
- Use the same problems/solutions in `samples/XX.tex` files, do not create new problems/solutions (if you have to, only minor modifications are allowed, e.g. change numerical values, etc) and inform me.


The structure (Sections) of the file `README.md` is similar to `/HSC-Induction/README.md` but about this project.

Difficulty criteria for easy/medium/hard classifications:
- Easy: Direct application of formulas (basic polynomials techniques, substitution, etc.)
- Medium: Multi-step problems combining 2-3 concepts
- Hard: Problems requiring creative approaches, proofs, or multiple complex techniques, often involving reduction formulae or advanced applications.
