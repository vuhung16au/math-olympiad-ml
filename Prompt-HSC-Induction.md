# Finish project on HSC Induction

Folder: `/HSC-Induction/`
Sample problems: `/HSC-Induction/samples/*.tex`

The objective of this project is to create a collection of HSC Math Extension 2 problems that are relevant, or can be solved using mathematical induction. The problems should be suitable for HSC students.

Folder structure of this project (`/HSC-Induction/`) is similar to `/HSC-Collections/`. E.g.

- Makefile 
- HSC-Induction.tex
- samples/
- problems/
- solutions/
- styles/: use the same styles as `/HSC-Collections/styles/`
- releases/
- README.md
- .gitignore
(Do not create build.bat, build.ps1, Makefile for Windows.)

The content of the file `HSC-Induction.tex` is as follows:

- Intro to this project
- Target audience: students who are preparing for HSC Math Extension 2 who want to challenge themselves with difficult problems and develop advanced problem-solving skills using induction.
- Introduction to induction

Part 1: Problems and Solutions (Detailed solutions)
- (easy problems) Basic induction problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- (medium problems) Medium induction problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- (hard problems) Advanced induction problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
(Do not show Hints for problems in Part 1, just state the problems and show the solutions.)

Part 2: Problems and Solutions (less detailed solutions)
- (easy problems) Basic induction problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
- (medium problems) Medium induction problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
- (hard problems) Advanced induction problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
For problems in Part 2, show Hints for problems.
- Conclusion & good luck!

The structure (Sections) of the file `README.md` is similar to `/HSC-Collections/README.md` but about this project.
