% Part 1, Problem 6: Odd integer squared minus 1 divisible by 8 - Direct Proof
% Medium

\begin{problem}[Medium]
Prove that if $a$ is any odd integer, then $a^2 - 1$ is divisible by 8.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{Direct Proof}

\textbf{Step 1: Express $a$ as an odd integer}

Since $a$ is odd, we can write:
\[ a = 2k + 1 \]
for some integer $k$.

\textbf{Step 2: Expand $a^2 - 1$}

\begin{align*}
    a^2 - 1 &= (2k + 1)^2 - 1 \\
    &= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 1 \\
    &= 4k^2 + 4k \\
    &= 4k(k + 1)
\end{align*}

\textbf{Step 3: Analyze $k(k+1)$}

Note that $k$ and $(k+1)$ are consecutive integers. 

Therefore, one of them must be even, which means their product $k(k+1)$ is divisible by 2.

Write $k(k+1) = 2m$ for some integer $m$.

\textbf{Step 4: Substitute and conclude}

\begin{align*}
    a^2 - 1 &= 4 \cdot k(k+1) \\
    &= 4 \cdot 2m \\
    &= 8m
\end{align*}

Since $a^2 - 1 = 8m$, we conclude that $a^2 - 1$ is divisible by 8.

\hfill $\square$
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Odd Integer Form:} Any odd integer can be written as $2k+1$ for some integer $k$
\item \textbf{Consecutive Integer Property:} Product of consecutive integers $k(k+1)$ is always even (one must be even)
\item \textbf{Factor Extraction:} From $4k(k+1) = 4 \cdot 2m = 8m$, directly see divisibility by 8
\item \textbf{Alternative View:} Can also factor $a^2-1 = (a-1)(a+1)$, both even for odd $a$, with one divisible by 4
\end{itemize}
