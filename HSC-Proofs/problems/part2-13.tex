\begin{problem}[Hard]
Prove or disprove: There exists a real number $n$ such that $3^n + 4^n < 5^n$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
The statement is \textbf{true}. Try a few values: $n = 2$ gives $9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$ (equality, not $<$).

Try $n = 3$: Is $3^3 + 4^3 < 5^3$? Calculate $27 + 64$ vs $125$.

Alternatively, divide by $5^n$ to get $(3/5)^n + (4/5)^n < 1$ and analyze the function behavior.
\end{hint}

\begin{solutionsketch}
The statement is \textbf{true}.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Proof by Example:}

Try $n = 3$:
\begin{align*}
3^3 + 4^3 &= 27 + 64 = 91 \\
5^3 &= 125
\end{align*}

Since $91 < 125$, the inequality $3^3 + 4^3 < 5^3$ holds.

Therefore, $n = 3$ is a real number satisfying the inequality. $\qed$

\textbf{Alternative Proof (Analysis):}

Divide the inequality by $5^n$:
\[
\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^n + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n < 1
\]

Let $f(n) = \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^n + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n$.

\begin{itemize}
\item At $n = 2$: $f(2) = \frac{9}{25} + \frac{16}{25} = 1$ (equality)
\item The derivative: $f'(n) = \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^n \ln\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n \ln\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)$

Since $\frac{3}{5} < 1$ and $\frac{4}{5} < 1$, both logarithms are negative, so $f'(n) < 0$.

\item Therefore, $f(n)$ is strictly decreasing.
\end{itemize}

Since $f(2) = 1$ and $f$ is strictly decreasing, for any $n > 2$, we have $f(n) < 1$.

Thus, the inequality holds for all $n > 2$. In particular, it holds for $n = 3$ (and infinitely many other values). $\qed$

\textit{Note: This shows the power of the "divide by largest term" technique in inequality problems. The critical point is $n = 2$ where equality holds (Pythagorean triple: $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$).}
