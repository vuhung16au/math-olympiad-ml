\begin{problem}[Hard]
Prove or disprove: If $x$ and $y$ are irrational numbers with $x \neq y$, then $xy$ is irrational.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
The statement is \textbf{false}. Find a counterexample using multiples of $\sqrt{2}$.

Consider $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $y = k\sqrt{2}$ for some rational $k \neq 1$. What is $xy$? Is it rational or irrational?
\end{hint}

\begin{solutionsketch}
The statement is \textbf{false}. We disprove by counterexample.

\textbf{Counterexample:}

Let $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $y = 2\sqrt{2}$.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Check $x$ is irrational:} $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational (well-known).
\item \textbf{Check $y$ is irrational:} $2\sqrt{2}$ is the product of rational $2$ and irrational $\sqrt{2}$, so it's irrational.
\item \textbf{Check $x \neq y$:} Clearly $\sqrt{2} \neq 2\sqrt{2}$ since $1 \neq 2$.
\item \textbf{Compute $xy$:}
\[
xy = (\sqrt{2})(2\sqrt{2}) = 2 \cdot (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \cdot 2 = 4
\]
\item \textbf{Check rationality of $xy$:} $4 = \frac{4}{1}$ is \textbf{rational}.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}

Since we found irrational numbers $x$ and $y$ with $x \neq y$ such that $xy$ is rational, the original statement is \textbf{disproven}. $\qed$

\textit{Note: This shows that the irrationals are not closed under multiplication. The rationals are closed under multiplication, but the irrationals are not.}
