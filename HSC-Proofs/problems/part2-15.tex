\begin{problem}[Hard]
Prove by induction that $4^{n+1} + 6^n$ is divisible by $10$ when $n$ is an even positive integer.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Since $n$ is even, let $n = 2k$ for $k \geq 1$. Prove by induction on $k$ that $4^{2k+1} + 6^{2k}$ is divisible by $10$.

For the inductive step:
\begin{itemize}
\item Express $4^{2(k+1)+1} + 6^{2(k+1)}$ as $16 \cdot 4^{2k+1} + 36 \cdot 6^{2k}$
\item From IH: $6^{2k} = 10M - 4^{2k+1}$ for some integer $M$
\item Substitute and factor out $10$
\end{itemize}
\end{hint}

\begin{solutionsketch}
Since $n$ is an even positive integer, let $n = 2k$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

We prove by induction on $k$ that $P(k)$: "$4^{2k+1} + 6^{2k}$ is divisible by $10$" holds for all $k \geq 1$.

\textbf{Base case ($k=1$, i.e., $n=2$):}
\[
4^{2(1)+1} + 6^{2(1)} = 4^3 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100 = 10 \times 10
\]
Divisible by $10$. \checkmark

\textbf{Inductive hypothesis:}

Assume $P(k)$ holds: $4^{2k+1} + 6^{2k} = 10M$ for some integer $M$.

From this: $6^{2k} = 10M - 4^{2k+1}$

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Inductive step:}

Prove $P(k+1)$: $4^{2(k+1)+1} + 6^{2(k+1)}$ is divisible by $10$.

\begin{align*}
4^{2(k+1)+1} + 6^{2(k+1)} &= 4^{2k+3} + 6^{2k+2} \\
&= 4^2 \cdot 4^{2k+1} + 6^2 \cdot 6^{2k} \\
&= 16 \cdot 4^{2k+1} + 36 \cdot 6^{2k}
\end{align*}

Substitute $6^{2k} = 10M - 4^{2k+1}$ from IH:
\begin{align*}
&= 16 \cdot 4^{2k+1} + 36(10M - 4^{2k+1}) \\
&= 16 \cdot 4^{2k+1} + 360M - 36 \cdot 4^{2k+1} \\
&= 360M + (16 - 36) \cdot 4^{2k+1} \\
&= 360M - 20 \cdot 4^{2k+1} \\
&= 10(36M - 2 \cdot 4^{2k+1})
\end{align*}

Since $M$ and $4^{2k+1}$ are integers, $36M - 2 \cdot 4^{2k+1}$ is an integer.

Therefore, $4^{2(k+1)+1} + 6^{2(k+1)}$ is divisible by $10$. \checkmark

\vspace{0.3cm}

By the principle of mathematical induction, $P(k)$ holds for all $k \geq 1$.

Therefore, $4^{n+1} + 6^n$ is divisible by $10$ for all even positive integers $n$. $\qed$
