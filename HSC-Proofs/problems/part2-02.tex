\begin{problem}[Easy]
If $a$ is rational and $b$ is irrational, prove that $a + b$ is irrational.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Use proof by contradiction. Assume $a + b$ is rational, then solve for $b$ in terms of rational numbers. What property of rational numbers does this contradict?
\end{hint}

\textbf{Proof by Contradiction:}

Assume, for contradiction, that $a + b$ is rational.

Since $a$ is rational and $a + b$ is rational (by assumption), we can write:
\begin{align*}
a &= \frac{p}{q} \quad \text{where } p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0 \\
a + b &= \frac{r}{s} \quad \text{where } r, s \in \mathbb{Z}, s \neq 0
\end{align*}

Solving for $b$:
\[
b = (a + b) - a = \frac{r}{s} - \frac{p}{q} = \frac{rq - ps}{sq}
\]

Since $r, q, p, s$ are all integers and $sq \neq 0$, this shows $b$ is expressible as a ratio of two integers.

Therefore, $b$ must be rational, which \textbf{contradicts} the given condition that $b$ is irrational.

Hence, our assumption was false, and $a + b$ must be irrational. $\qed$
