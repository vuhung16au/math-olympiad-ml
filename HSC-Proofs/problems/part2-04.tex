\begin{problem}[Easy]
Prove that for positive integers $a, b$ with $a > 1$, either $b$ is not divisible by $a$ or $b + 1$ is not divisible by $a$ (or both).
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Use proof by contradiction. Assume both $a|b$ and $a|(b+1)$. What does this tell you about $a|[(b+1) - b]$? What can you conclude about $a$?
\end{hint}

\textbf{Proof by Contradiction:}

The statement is equivalent to: "It is not the case that both $a|b$ and $a|(b+1)$."

Assume, for contradiction, that \textbf{both} $a|b$ and $a|(b+1)$.

Then there exist integers $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that:
\begin{align*}
b &= ak_1 \\
b + 1 &= ak_2
\end{align*}

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[
(b+1) - b = ak_2 - ak_1
\]
\[
1 = a(k_2 - k_1)
\]

Let $K = k_2 - k_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $1 = aK$, which means $a$ divides $1$.

Since $a$ is a positive integer, the only positive divisor of $1$ is $1$ itself. Therefore, $a = 1$.

This \textbf{contradicts} the given condition that $a > 1$.

Hence, our assumption must be false, and at least one of $b$ or $b+1$ is not divisible by $a$. $\qed$
