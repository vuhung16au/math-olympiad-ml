\begin{problem}[Medium]
Prove that there are no positive integers $x, y$ such that $x^2 - y^2 = 1$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Factor the left side as a difference of squares: $(x-y)(x+y) = 1$.

For this product to equal $1$, what must be true about the integer factors $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$? Consider all possible integer factor pairs of $1$.
\end{hint}

\begin{solutionsketch}
Factor the equation:
\[
x^2 - y^2 = 1 \implies (x-y)(x+y) = 1
\]

Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ are integers.

For the product of two integers to equal $1$, the only possibilities are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $x - y = 1$ and $x + y = 1$, or
\item $x - y = -1$ and $x + y = -1$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Case 1:} $x - y = 1$ and $x + y = 1$

Adding these equations: $2x = 2$, so $x = 1$.

Substituting back: $1 + y = 1$, so $y = 0$.

Since $y = 0$ is not a positive integer, this case fails.

\textbf{Case 2:} $x - y = -1$ and $x + y = -1$

Adding these equations: $2x = -2$, so $x = -1$.

Since $x = -1$ is not a positive integer, this case fails.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Conclusion:} Neither case yields a solution with both $x$ and $y$ positive integers.

Therefore, there are no positive integers $x, y$ such that $x^2 - y^2 = 1$. $\qed$
