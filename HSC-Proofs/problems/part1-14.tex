\begin{problem}[Hard]
Prove by induction that $x^n - y^n$ is divisible by $x - y$ for all positive integers $n$, where $x, y$ are integers with $x \neq y$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{Proof by Mathematical Induction}

\textbf{Base Case} ($n=1$):

For $n=1$:
\[ x^1 - y^1 = x - y \]

Since $x - y$ is divisible by $x - y$, the statement holds for $n=1$. \checkmark

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:}

Assume the statement is true for $n=k$, where $k$ is a positive integer:
\[ x^k - y^k \text{ is divisible by } x - y \]

This means we can write:
\[ x^k - y^k = m(x - y) \]
for some integer $m$.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Inductive Step:}

We must prove the statement for $n=k+1$:
\[ x^{k+1} - y^{k+1} \text{ is divisible by } x - y \]

Start with $x^{k+1} - y^{k+1}$ and manipulate to introduce $x^k - y^k$:
\begin{align*}
    x^{k+1} - y^{k+1} &= x^{k+1} - xy^k + xy^k - y^{k+1} \\
    &= x(x^k - y^k) + y^k(x - y)
\end{align*}

Substitute the inductive hypothesis $x^k - y^k = m(x-y)$:
\begin{align*}
    x^{k+1} - y^{k+1} &= x \cdot m(x-y) + y^k(x-y) \\
    &= (x-y)(xm + y^k)
\end{align*}

Since $x, y, m, k$ are all integers, $M = xm + y^k$ is an integer.

Therefore:
\[ x^{k+1} - y^{k+1} = M(x-y) \]

This shows $x^{k+1} - y^{k+1}$ is divisible by $x-y$. \checkmark

\textbf{Conclusion:}

By mathematical induction, $x^n - y^n$ is divisible by $x - y$ for all positive integers $n$.

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strategic Addition/Subtraction:} Add and subtract $xy^k$ to create terms involving $x^k - y^k$ and $x - y$
\item \textbf{Factorization:} Extract common factor $(x-y)$ after rearrangement
\item \textbf{Induction Crossover:} Problem appears in both HSC-Induction and HSC-Proofs collections, showing technique overlap
\item \textbf{Alternative Formula:} Result leads to $x^n - y^n = (x-y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \ldots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1})$
