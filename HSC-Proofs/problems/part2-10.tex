\begin{problem}[Medium]
Prove that $x$ is even if and only if $x^2$ is even (for integer $x$).
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
This is a biconditional (iff) statement requiring two proofs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Direction 1: If $x$ is even, then $x^2$ is even (direct proof).
\item Direction 2: If $x^2$ is even, then $x$ is even (try contrapositive: if $x$ is odd, then $x^2$ is odd).
\end{itemize}
\end{hint}

\begin{solutionsketch}
\textbf{Direction 1 ($\Rightarrow$):} If $x$ is even, then $x^2$ is even.

Assume $x$ is even. Then $x = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

Therefore:
\[
x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)
\]

Since $2k^2$ is an integer, $x^2$ is even by definition.

\textbf{Direction 2 ($\Leftarrow$):} If $x^2$ is even, then $x$ is even.

We prove the contrapositive: If $x$ is odd, then $x^2$ is odd.

Assume $x$ is odd. Then $x = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.

Therefore:
\begin{align*}
x^2 &= (2k+1)^2 \\
&= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\
&= 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1
\end{align*}

Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is an integer, $x^2$ is odd by definition.

By contrapositive, if $x^2$ is even, then $x$ must be even.

\textbf{Conclusion:} Both directions proven, so $x$ is even $\iff$ $x^2$ is even. $\qed$

\textit{Note: This result is fundamental in many irrationality proofs (e.g., $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational). If $p$ is an odd prime and $p|x^2$, then $p|x$.}
