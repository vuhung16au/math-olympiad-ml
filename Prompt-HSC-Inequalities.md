# Finish project on HSC Inequalities

Folder: `/HSC-Inequalities/`
Sample problems: 
- `/HSC-Inequalities/samples/`

The objective of this project is to create a collection of HSC Math Extension 2 problems that are relevant to inequalities. The problems should be suitable for HSC students.

Folder structure of this project (`/HSC-Inequalities/`) is similar to `/HSC-Induction/`. E.g.

- Makefile 
- HSC-Inequalities.tex
- samples/
- problems/
- solutions/
- styles/: use the same styles as `/HSC-Induction/styles/`
- releases/
- README.md
- .gitignore

The content of the file `HSC-Inequalities.tex` is as follows:

- Intro to this project
 Brief review of inequalities fundamentals. Pls refer to `HSC-Inequalities/samples/00-basic.tex` to cover basic inequalities.
 Key theorems/formulas students should know (triangle inequality, AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz, etc.)
 Notation and conventions used in this project.


`README.md` should contain the following sections:
- Introduction
- What this project is about, the audience it is for
- How to build this project
- Conclusion & good luck!

# Key Inequality Topics 

HSC Extension 2 questions on inequalities typically cover the following topics:

- The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality
- The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
- Integration Inequalities
- The Triangle Inequality
- Inequalities via Induction

- Target audience: students who are preparing for HSC Math Extension 2 who want to challenge themselves with difficult problems and develop advanced problem-solving skills using inequalities.

Part 1: Problems and Solutions (Detailed solutions)
- (easy problems) Basic inequalities problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- (medium problems) Medium inequalities problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- (hard problems) Advanced inequalities problems: you pick 5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
(Do not show Hints for problems in Part 1, just state the problems and show the solutions.)
So, that Part 1 has 3x5 = 15 problems.

Part 2: Problems and Solutions (less detailed solutions)
- (easy problems) Basic inequalities problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
- (medium problems) Medium inequalities problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
- (hard problems) Advanced inequalities problems: you pick problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them (less detailed solutions)
For problems in Part 2, show Hints for problems.
- Conclusion & good luck!

Part 1 and Part 2 aim for roughly equal distribution across difficulty levels.

Note:
- We have about 33 sample problems in the folder `samples/`. You can pick any 3x5 problems from the folder `samples/` and solve them in detail.
- And you pick the rest of the problems and solve them (less detailed solutions).
- Make sure no problem is repeated in Part 1 and Part 2.

The structure (Sections) of the file `README.md` is similar to `/HSC-Induction/README.md` but about this project.

Difficulty criteria for easy/medium/hard classifications:
- Easy: Direct application of formulas (AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz, etc.)
- Medium: Multi-step problems combining 2-3 concepts
- Hard: Problems requiring creative approaches, proofs, or multiple complex techniques
