# math-olympiad-ml

A collection of documents and findings on IMO-level mathematics and machine learning/AI topics. This repository contains various mathematical problems, proofs, and computational solutions ranging from olympiad-level problems to advanced mathematical analysis.

## Sub-Projects

### [HSC_sqrt_un](./HSC_sqrt_un/)

HSC Mathematics sequence proof project. Contains LaTeX documents and proofs related to sequence problems, including compiled PDF outputs.

### [quintic](./quintic/)

**Quintic Equation Solver** - A Python-based solver using SymPy to solve quintic equations (polynomial equations of degree 5). Demonstrates symbolic and numerical approaches to finding solutions for equations like \( x^5 - 5x^3 + 5x - 4 = 0 \).

### [sequence_a_n](./sequence_a_n/)

Problem T6-219 - A sequence analysis problem involving recursive sequences and limit inferior proofs. Contains problem statement (PDF), LaTeX source, and analysis notes.

### [StrangeNestSquareRoots](./StrangeNestSquareRoots/)

Explorations of nested square root problems. See the [external repository](https://github.com/vuhung16au/MachineLearning-GenAI/tree/main/StrangeNestSquareRoots) for more details.
