\chapter{Metaphors and Intuition}
This appendix collects useful metaphors and intuitive explanations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Manifold:} Like a small bug walking on a giant, oddly shaped donut---to the bug, the surface feels flat locally, but really it loops back and curves.
\item \textbf{Geodesic:} Like the path of a tightrope between two points on a curved dome, always ``the shortest rope'' route that sticks to the surface.
\item \textbf{Distance on Sphere:} Like the distance between two cities on Earth measured by flight routes that follow arcs, not straight tunnels through Earth.
\end{itemize}
