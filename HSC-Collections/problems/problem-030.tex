\subsection{Problem 30: Proposition Logic}

\begin{problem}
In the set of integers, let $P$ be the proposition: 'If $k+1$ is divisible by 3, then $k^3+1$ is divisible by 3'.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Prove that the proposition $P$ is true.
    
    \item[(ii)] Write down the contrapositive of the proposition $P$.
    
    \item[(iii)] Write down the converse of the proposition $P$ and state, with reasons, whether this converse is true or false.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), if $k+1 = 3m$, then $k = 3m-1$. Expand $k^3+1$ and show it's divisible by 3. For part (ii), the contrapositive is 'If $k^3+1$ is not divisible by 3, then $k+1$ is not divisible by 3'. For part (iii), test the converse with counterexamples.
\end{hint}
