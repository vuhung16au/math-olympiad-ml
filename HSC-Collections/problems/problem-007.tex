\subsection{Problem 7: 3D Vectors and Distance}

\begin{problem}
Consider the point $B$ with three-dimensional position vector $\mathbf{b}$ and the line $l$: $\mathbf{a} + \lambda \mathbf{d}$, where $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ are three-dimensional vectors, $|\mathbf{d}| = 1$ and $\lambda$ is a parameter.

Let $f(\lambda)$ be the distance between a point on the line $l$ and the point $B$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Find $\lambda_0$, the value of $\lambda$ that minimises $f$, in terms of $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{d}$.
    
    \item[(ii)] Let $P$ be the point with position vector $\mathbf{a} + \lambda_0 \mathbf{d}$. Show that $PB$ is perpendicular to the direction of the line $l$.
    
    \item[(iii)] Hence, or otherwise, find the shortest distance between the line $l$ and the sphere of radius 1 unit, centred at the origin $O$, in terms of $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{a}$.
    
    You may assume that if $B$ is the point on the sphere closest to $l$, then $OBP$ is a straight line.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), minimize $f^2(\lambda)$ by differentiating. For part (ii), use the fact that the minimum distance occurs when the vector from $P$ to $B$ is perpendicular to the direction vector. For part (iii), use the geometric interpretation and the given assumption.
\end{hint}
