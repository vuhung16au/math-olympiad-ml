\subsection{Problem 2: Complex Square with Equilateral Triangle}

\begin{problem}
A square in the Argand plane has vertices
\[
5 + 5i, \quad 5 - 5i, \quad -5 - 5i \quad \text{and} \quad -5 + 5i.
\]
The complex numbers $z_A = 5 + i$, $z_B$ and $z_C$ lie on the square and form the vertices of an equilateral triangle.

Find the exact value of the complex number $z_B$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Use the geometric properties of equilateral triangles. Consider rotations in the complex plane. The vertices of an equilateral triangle are related by rotations of $60^\circ$ or $120^\circ$ about the centroid.
\end{hint}
