\subsection{Problem 15: Integer Equation with Large Exponents}

\begin{problem}
Explain why there is no integer $n$ such that $(n + 1)^{41} - 79n^{40} = 2$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Consider the equation modulo a small prime number. Try working modulo 2, 3, or other small primes. Also consider the binomial expansion of $(n+1)^{41}$ and look for divisibility properties.
\end{hint}
