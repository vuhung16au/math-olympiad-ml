\subsection{Problem 28: Induction Proof for Series}

\begin{problem}
Prove by mathematical induction that, for $n \ge 2$,
\[
\frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{n^2} < \frac{n-1}{n}.
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For the base case, check $n = 2$. For the inductive step, assume the inequality holds for $n = k$ and show it holds for $n = k+1$ by adding $\frac{1}{(k+1)^2}$ to both sides and manipulating the inequality.
\end{hint}
