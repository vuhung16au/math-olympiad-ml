\subsection{Problem 8: Triangle Inequality and Rectangular Prism}

\begin{problem}
It is given that for positive numbers $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n$ with arithmetic mean $A$,
\[
\frac{x_1 \times x_2 \times x_3 \times \dots \times x_n}{A^n} \leq 1. \quad (\text{Do NOT prove this.})
\]

Suppose a rectangular prism has dimensions $a, b, c$ and surface area $S$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $abc \leq \left(\frac{S}{6}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}$.
    
    \item[(ii)] Using part (i), show that when the rectangular prism with surface area $S$ is a cube, it has maximum volume.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), relate the surface area to the dimensions and apply the given inequality. For part (ii), show that equality in the inequality from part (i) occurs when $a = b = c$, which corresponds to a cube.
\end{hint}
