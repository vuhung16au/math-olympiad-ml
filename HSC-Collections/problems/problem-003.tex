\subsection{Problem 3: Complex 7th Root of Unity}

\begin{problem}
Let $w$ be a complex number such that $1 + w + w^2 + \dots + w^6 = 0$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $w$ is a 7th root of unity.
    
    \item[(ii)] The complex number $\alpha = w + w^2 + w^4$ is a root of the equation $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $b$ and $c$ are real and $\alpha$ is not real. Find the other root of $x^2 + bx + c = 0$ in terms of positive powers of $w$.
    
    \item[(iii)] Find the numerical value of $c$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. For part (ii), use the fact that for a quadratic with real coefficients, the other root is the complex conjugate. For part (iii), use properties of roots of unity and their relationships.
\end{hint}
