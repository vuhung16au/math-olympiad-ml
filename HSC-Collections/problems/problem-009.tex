\subsection{Problem 9: Three Unit Vectors Optimization}

\begin{problem}
Three unit vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$, in 3 dimensions, are to be chosen so that $\mathbf{a} \perp \mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{b} \perp \mathbf{c}$ and the angle $\theta$ between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}$ is as small as possible.

What is the value of $\cos\theta$?
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Use the dot product to express $\cos\theta$ in terms of the vectors. Consider the constraints and use Lagrange multipliers or geometric reasoning. The optimal configuration occurs when the vectors are arranged symmetrically.
\end{hint}
