\subsection{Problem 27: Particle Falling with Resistance}

\begin{problem}
A particle starts from rest and falls through a resisting medium so that its acceleration, in m/s$^2$, is modelled by
\[
a = 10(1 - (kv)^2),
\]
where $v$ is the velocity of the particle in m/s and $k = 0.01$.

Find the velocity of the particle after 5 seconds.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Use $a = \frac{dv}{dt}$ and separate variables. The equation is $\frac{dv}{dt} = 10(1 - 0.0001v^2)$. This is a separable differential equation. Find the terminal velocity first.
\end{hint}
