\subsection{Problem 11: Vectors and Complex Numbers}

\begin{problem}
Consider the three vectors $\mathbf{a}=\vec{OA}$, $\mathbf{b}=\vec{OB}$ and $\mathbf{c}=\vec{OC}$, where $O$ is the origin and the points $A$, $B$ and $C$ are all different from each other and the origin.

The point $M$ is the point such that $\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}) = \vec{OM}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $M$ lies on the line passing through $A$ and $B$.
    
    \item[(ii)] The point $G$ is the point such that $\frac{1}{3}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}) = \vec{OG}$. Show that $G$ lies on the line passing through $M$ and $C$, and lies between $M$ and $C$.
    
    \item[(iii)] The complex numbers $x$, $w$ and $z$ are all different and all have modulus 1. Using part (ii), or otherwise, show that $\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)$ is never a cube root of $xwz$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), express $M$ as a linear combination of $A$ and $B$. For part (ii), show that $G$ can be written as a weighted combination of $M$ and $C$. For part (iii), use the geometric interpretation: if $\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)$ were a cube root of $xwz$, what would that imply about the positions on the unit circle?
\end{hint}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 11: Vectors and Complex Numbers}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{(i)} Since $\vec{OM} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})$, we can write:
\[
\vec{OM} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} + \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})
\]
This shows $M$ lies on the line through $A$ (when parameter = 0) and $B$ (when parameter = 1).

\textbf{(ii)} We have $\vec{OG} = \frac{1}{3}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) + \frac{1}{3}\mathbf{c} = \frac{2}{3}\vec{OM} + \frac{1}{3}\mathbf{c}$.

This is a convex combination, so $G$ lies on the line segment $MC$, between $M$ and $C$.

\textbf{(iii)} Suppose $\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z) = (xwz)^{1/3}$ for some cube root. Then $|\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)| = |(xwz)^{1/3}| = 1$.

But by the triangle inequality: $|\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)| \leq \frac{1}{3}(|x|+|w|+|z|) = 1$.

Equality occurs only if $x$, $w$, $z$ all have the same argument. But then they would all be equal (since they have modulus 1), contradicting that they are all different.

Therefore, $\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)$ is never a cube root of $xwz$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Midpoint: $\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})$ lies on line $AB$
    \item Centroid: $\frac{1}{3}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})$ lies between midpoint and third vertex
    \item Triangle inequality: equality requires collinear vectors with same direction
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}
