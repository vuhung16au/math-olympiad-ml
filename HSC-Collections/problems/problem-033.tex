\subsection{Problem 33: Two Masses with Pulley}

\begin{problem}
Two masses, $2m$ kg and $4m$ kg, are attached by a light string. The string is placed over a smooth pulley as shown below. The two masses are at rest before being released and $v$ is the velocity of the larger mass at time $t$ seconds after they are released.

The force due to air resistance on each mass has magnitude $kv$, where $k$ is a positive constant.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that
    \[
    \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{gm - kv}{3m}.
    \]
    
    \item[(ii)] Given that $v < \frac{gm}{k}$, show that when $t = \frac{3m}{k}\ln 2$, the velocity of the larger mass is $\frac{gm}{2k}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), apply Newton's second law to each mass, considering tensions and resistance. For part (ii), solve the differential equation and substitute the given time.
\end{hint}
