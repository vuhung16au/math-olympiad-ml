\subsection{Problem 25: Complex Numbers with Three Conditions}

\begin{problem}
Find all the complex numbers $z_1, z_2, z_3$ that satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously:
\[
\begin{cases}
|z_1| = |z_2| = |z_3| \\
z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 1 \\
z_1 z_2 z_3 = 1
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Since all have the same modulus, write $z_k = re^{i\theta_k}$. Use the sum and product conditions. Consider the geometric interpretation: three complex numbers on a circle that sum to 1 and multiply to 1.
\end{hint}
