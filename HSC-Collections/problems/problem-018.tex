\subsection{Problem 18: Curve on a Sphere}

\begin{problem}
A curve $C$ spirals 3 times around the sphere centred at the origin and with radius 3, as shown below.

A particle is initially at the point $(0, 0, -3)$ and moves along the curve $C$ on the surface of the sphere, ending at the point $(0, 0, 3)$.

By using the diagram below, which shows the graphs of the functions $f(x)=\cos(\pi x)$ and $g(x)=\sqrt{9-x^{2}}$, and considering the graph $y=f(x)g(x)$, give a possible set of parametric equations that describe the curve $C$.

\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
The curve is on a sphere of radius 3, so $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9$. The function $g(x) = \sqrt{9-x^2}$ suggests a relationship with the sphere. Use $f(x) = \cos(\pi x)$ to create the spiraling effect. Consider parameterizing with $t$ such that $z$ goes from $-3$ to $3$ as the parameter increases.
