\subsection{Problem 24: Projectile with Linear Resistance}

\begin{problem}
A projectile of mass $M$ kg is launched vertically upwards from a horizontal plane with initial speed $v_0$ m s$^{-1}$ which is less than $100$ m s$^{-1}$.

The projectile experiences a resistive force which has magnitude $0.1Mv$ newtons, where $v$ m s$^{-1}$ is the speed of the projectile.

The acceleration due to gravity is $10$ m s$^{-2}$.

The projectile lands on the horizontal plane 7 seconds after launch.

Find the value of $v_0$, correct to 1 decimal place.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Set up the differential equation for motion with linear resistance: $\frac{dv}{dt} = -g - 0.1v$. Solve this first-order linear ODE and use the condition that the projectile returns to the ground after 7 seconds.
\end{hint}
