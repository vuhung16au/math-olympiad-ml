\subsection{Problem 12: Bar Magnet and Falling Object}

\begin{problem}
A bar magnet is held vertically. An object that is repelled by the magnet is to be dropped from directly above the magnet and will maintain a vertical trajectory.

Let $x$ be the distance of the object above the magnet.

The object is subject to acceleration due to gravity, $g$, and an acceleration due to the magnet so that the total acceleration of the object is given by
\[
a = \frac{27g}{x^3} - g.
\]
The object is released from rest at $x=6$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $v^2 = g\left(\frac{51}{4} - 2x - \frac{27}{x^2}\right)$.
    
    \item[(ii)] Find where the object next comes to rest, giving your answer correct to 1 decimal place.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), use $a = v \frac{dv}{dx}$ and integrate. For part (ii), set $v = 0$ and solve the resulting equation. You may need to use numerical methods or factor the polynomial.
\end{hint}
