\subsection{Problem 19: Complex Numbers and Equilateral Triangles}

\begin{problem}
Let $w$ be the complex number
\[
w=e^{\frac{2i\pi}{3}}.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $1+w+w^{2}=0$.
    
    \item[(ii)] Three complex numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ are represented in the complex plane by points $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively. Show that if triangle $ABC$ is anticlockwise and equilateral, then $a+bw+cw^{2}=0$.
    
    \item[(iii)] It can be shown that if triangle $ABC$ is clockwise and equilateral, then $a+bw^{2}+cw=0$. (Do NOT prove this.) Show that if $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle, then
    \[
    a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=ab+bc+ca.
    \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), use the geometric series formula or note that $w$ is a cube root of unity. For part (ii), use the fact that rotating an equilateral triangle by $120^\circ$ maps vertices to each other. For part (iii), use both the anticlockwise and clockwise conditions, and manipulate the equations.
\end{hint}
