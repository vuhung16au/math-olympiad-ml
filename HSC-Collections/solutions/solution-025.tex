\subsection{Solution to Problem 25: Complex Numbers with Three Conditions}

\begin{solution}
Since $|z_1| = |z_2| = |z_3| = r$ (say), write $z_k = re^{i\theta_k}$ for $k = 1, 2, 3$.

From $z_1 z_2 z_3 = 1$: $r^3 e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3)} = 1$.

Since the right-hand side is real and positive, we need $r^3 = 1$ (so $r = 1$) and $\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 = 2\pi k$ for some integer $k$.

So all three numbers lie on the unit circle: $z_k = e^{i\theta_k}$.

From $z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 1$: $e^{i\theta_1} + e^{i\theta_2} + e^{i\theta_3} = 1$.

Since the sum is real, the imaginary parts must cancel. One approach is to look for symmetric solutions where two numbers are complex conjugates.

Let $z_1 = 1$ (real), $z_2 = e^{i\theta}$, and $z_3 = e^{-i\theta}$ (conjugate pair).

Then $z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 1 + 2\cos\theta = 1$, so $\cos\theta = 0$, giving $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ or $\frac{3\pi}{2}$.

For $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$: $z_1 = 1$, $z_2 = i$, $z_3 = -i$.

Check: $|1| = |i| = |-i| = 1$ $\checkmark$, $1 + i + (-i) = 1$ $\checkmark$, $1 \cdot i \cdot (-i) = 1$ $\checkmark$.

For $\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}$: $z_1 = 1$, $z_2 = -i$, $z_3 = i$ (same solution, permuted).

By symmetry, we can also have $z_2 = 1$ or $z_3 = 1$ with the other two being $i$ and $-i$.

Therefore, the solutions are all permutations of $\{1, i, -i\}$.

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit circle: If $|z| = 1$, write $z = e^{i\theta}$
    \item Sum and product: Use both conditions to find relationships between angles
    \item Symmetry: Look for symmetric solutions (conjugate pairs)
\end{itemize}
