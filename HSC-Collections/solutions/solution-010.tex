\subsection{Solution to Problem 10: Complex Numbers with Argument Condition}

\begin{solution}
Given $\arg(z/w) = -\pi/2$, we have $z/w = -ik$ for some real $k > 0$, so $z = -ikw$.

Then:
\[
\left|\frac{z-w}{z+w}\right| = \left|\frac{-ikw - w}{-ikw + w}\right| = \left|\frac{-w(1+ik)}{w(1-ik)}\right| = \left|\frac{1+ik}{1-ik}\right| = \frac{|1+ik|}{|1-ik|} = \frac{\sqrt{1+k^2}}{\sqrt{1+k^2}} = 1
\]

Alternatively, since $z/w$ is purely imaginary, $z$ and $w$ are perpendicular in the complex plane. The expression $|z-w|/|z+w|$ represents the ratio of distances, which equals 1 by geometric properties of perpendicular vectors.

Therefore, $\left|\frac{z-w}{z+w}\right| = 1$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\arg(z/w) = -\pi/2$ means $z/w$ is purely imaginary (negative)
    \item Write $z = -ikw$ for real $k > 0$
    \item Simplify the modulus expression
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\begin{remark}
    An easy solution was actually geometric. 
    Note that the numerator and denominator were diagonals of a rectangle.
