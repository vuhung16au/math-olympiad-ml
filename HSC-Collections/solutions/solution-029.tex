\subsection{Solution to Problem 29: Irrationality of Logarithm}

\begin{solution}
Assume, for contradiction, that $\log_n(n+1) = \frac{p}{q}$ for some integers $p, q > 0$.

Then $n^{p/q} = n+1$, so $n^p = (n+1)^q$.

Since $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers, they are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).

The prime factorization of $n^p$ contains only primes dividing $n$, while $(n+1)^q$ contains only primes dividing $n+1$.

Since $n$ and $n+1$ are coprime, no prime can divide both, so $n^p = (n+1)^q$ is impossible unless $n^p = (n+1)^q = 1$.

But $n > 1$, so $n^p \ge 2^p \ge 2 > 1$, and $(n+1)^q \ge 3^q \ge 3 > 1$.

This is a contradiction. Therefore, $\log_n(n+1)$ is irrational.

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proof by contradiction: Assume the number is rational
    \item Coprime property: Consecutive integers are coprime
    \item Prime factorization: Use uniqueness of prime factorization to derive contradiction
