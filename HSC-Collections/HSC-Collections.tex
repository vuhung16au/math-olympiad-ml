\section{Problems}

\subsection{Problem 1: Two Particles in Resisting Medium}

\begin{problem}
Two particles, $A$ and $B$, each have mass 1 kg and are in a medium that exerts a resistance to motion equal to $kv$, where $k > 0$ and $v$ is the velocity of any particle. Both particles maintain vertical trajectories.

The acceleration due to gravity is $g$ m s$^{-2}$, where $g > 0$.

The two particles are simultaneously projected towards each other with the same speed, $v_0$ m s$^{-1}$, where $0 < v_0 < \frac{g}{k}$.

The particle $A$ is initially $d$ metres directly above particle $B$, where $d < \frac{2v_0}{k}$.

Find the time taken for the particles to meet.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Consider the equations of motion for each particle under the influence of gravity and resistance. Set up differential equations for the velocities and positions. The condition for the particles to meet will give you an equation involving time.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 2: Complex Square with Equilateral Triangle}

\begin{problem}
A square in the Argand plane has vertices
\[
5 + 5i, \quad 5 - 5i, \quad -5 - 5i \quad \text{and} \quad -5 + 5i.
\]
The complex numbers $z_A = 5 + i$, $z_B$ and $z_C$ lie on the square and form the vertices of an equilateral triangle.

Find the exact value of the complex number $z_B$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Use the geometric properties of equilateral triangles. Consider rotations in the complex plane. The vertices of an equilateral triangle are related by rotations of $60^\circ$ or $120^\circ$ about the centroid.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 3: Complex 7th Root of Unity}

\begin{problem}
Let $w$ be a complex number such that $1 + w + w^2 + \dots + w^6 = 0$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $w$ is a 7th root of unity.
    
    \item[(ii)] The complex number $\alpha = w + w^2 + w^4$ is a root of the equation $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $b$ and $c$ are real and $\alpha$ is not real. Find the other root of $x^2 + bx + c = 0$ in terms of positive powers of $w$.
    
    \item[(iii)] Find the numerical value of $c$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. For part (ii), use the fact that for a quadratic with real coefficients, the other root is the complex conjugate. For part (iii), use properties of roots of unity and their relationships.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 4: Complex Triangle Inequality}

\begin{problem}
The complex number $z$ satisfies $\left| z - \frac{4}{z} \right| = 2$.

Using the triangle inequality, or otherwise, show that $|z| \leq \sqrt{5} + 1$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Apply the triangle inequality to $|z - \frac{4}{z}|$. Consider both directions: $|z| - |\frac{4}{z}| \leq |z - \frac{4}{z}|$ and $|z - \frac{4}{z}| \leq |z| + |\frac{4}{z}|$. Use the given condition to derive bounds on $|z|$.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 5: Integral with Inverse Sine}

\begin{problem}
Using the substitution $x = \tan^2 \theta$, evaluate
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \sin^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{x}{1+x}} \,dx.
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
After making the substitution, simplify the integrand. You may need to use trigonometric identities. Consider the relationship between $\sin^{-1}$ and the substitution variable.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 6: Integral with Cotangent}

\begin{problem}
Let $I_n = \int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cot^{2n}\theta \, d\theta$ for integers $n \ge 0$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $I_n = \frac{1}{2n-1} - I_{n-1}$ for $n > 0$, given that $\frac{d}{d\theta}\cot\theta = -\csc^2\theta$.
    
    \item[(ii)] Hence, or otherwise, calculate $I_2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), use integration by parts. Write $\cot^{2n}\theta = \cot^{2n-2}\theta \cdot \cot^2\theta$ and use the identity $\cot^2\theta = \csc^2\theta - 1$. For part (ii), use the recurrence relation and find $I_0$ first.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 7: 3D Vectors and Distance}

\begin{problem}
Consider the point $B$ with three-dimensional position vector $\mathbf{b}$ and the line $l$: $\mathbf{a} + \lambda \mathbf{d}$, where $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ are three-dimensional vectors, $|\mathbf{d}| = 1$ and $\lambda$ is a parameter.

Let $f(\lambda)$ be the distance between a point on the line $l$ and the point $B$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Find $\lambda_0$, the value of $\lambda$ that minimises $f$, in terms of $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{d}$.
    
    \item[(ii)] Let $P$ be the point with position vector $\mathbf{a} + \lambda_0 \mathbf{d}$. Show that $PB$ is perpendicular to the direction of the line $l$.
    
    \item[(iii)] Hence, or otherwise, find the shortest distance between the line $l$ and the sphere of radius 1 unit, centred at the origin $O$, in terms of $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{a}$.
    
    You may assume that if $B$ is the point on the sphere closest to $l$, then $OBP$ is a straight line.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), minimize $f^2(\lambda)$ by differentiating. For part (ii), use the fact that the minimum distance occurs when the vector from $P$ to $B$ is perpendicular to the direction vector. For part (iii), use the geometric interpretation and the given assumption.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 8: Triangle Inequality and Rectangular Prism}

\begin{problem}
It is given that for positive numbers $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n$ with arithmetic mean $A$,
\[
\frac{x_1 \times x_2 \times x_3 \times \dots \times x_n}{A^n} \leq 1. \quad (\text{Do NOT prove this.})
\]

Suppose a rectangular prism has dimensions $a, b, c$ and surface area $S$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $abc \leq \left(\frac{S}{6}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}$.
    
    \item[(ii)] Using part (i), show that when the rectangular prism with surface area $S$ is a cube, it has maximum volume.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), relate the surface area to the dimensions and apply the given inequality. For part (ii), show that equality in the inequality from part (i) occurs when $a = b = c$, which corresponds to a cube.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 9: Three Unit Vectors Optimization}

\begin{problem}
Three unit vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$, in 3 dimensions, are to be chosen so that $\mathbf{a} \perp \mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{b} \perp \mathbf{c}$ and the angle $\theta$ between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}$ is as small as possible.

What is the value of $\cos\theta$?
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
Use the dot product to express $\cos\theta$ in terms of the vectors. Consider the constraints and use Lagrange multipliers or geometric reasoning. The optimal configuration occurs when the vectors are arranged symmetrically.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 10: Complex Numbers with Argument Condition}

\begin{problem}
For the complex numbers $z$ and $w$, it is known that $\arg\left(\frac{z}{w}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{2}$.

Find $\left|\frac{z-w}{z+w}\right|$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
The condition $\arg(z/w) = -\pi/2$ means $z/w$ is purely imaginary and negative. Write $z = -ikw$ for some real $k > 0$, or use geometric interpretation. Then simplify the expression $|z-w|/|z+w|$.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 11: Vectors and Complex Numbers}

\begin{problem}
Consider the three vectors $\mathbf{a}=\vec{OA}$, $\mathbf{b}=\vec{OB}$ and $\mathbf{c}=\vec{OC}$, where $O$ is the origin and the points $A$, $B$ and $C$ are all different from each other and the origin.

The point $M$ is the point such that $\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}) = \vec{OM}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $M$ lies on the line passing through $A$ and $B$.
    
    \item[(ii)] The point $G$ is the point such that $\frac{1}{3}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}) = \vec{OG}$. Show that $G$ lies on the line passing through $M$ and $C$, and lies between $M$ and $C$.
    
    \item[(iii)] The complex numbers $x$, $w$ and $z$ are all different and all have modulus 1. Using part (ii), or otherwise, show that $\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)$ is never a cube root of $xwz$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), express $M$ as a linear combination of $A$ and $B$. For part (ii), show that $G$ can be written as a weighted combination of $M$ and $C$. For part (iii), use the geometric interpretation: if $\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)$ were a cube root of $xwz$, what would that imply about the positions on the unit circle?
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 12: Bar Magnet and Falling Object}

\begin{problem}
A bar magnet is held vertically. An object that is repelled by the magnet is to be dropped from directly above the magnet and will maintain a vertical trajectory.

Let $x$ be the distance of the object above the magnet.

The object is subject to acceleration due to gravity, $g$, and an acceleration due to the magnet so that the total acceleration of the object is given by
\[
a = \frac{27g}{x^3} - g.
\]
The object is released from rest at $x=6$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $v^2 = g\left(\frac{51}{4} - 2x - \frac{27}{x^2}\right)$.
    
    \item[(ii)] Find where the object next comes to rest, giving your answer correct to 1 decimal place.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), use $a = v \frac{dv}{dx}$ and integrate. For part (ii), set $v = 0$ and solve the resulting equation. You may need to use numerical methods or factor the polynomial.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 13: Circle and Cosine Function}

\begin{problem}
Consider the function $y=\cos(kx)$ where $k>0$. The value of $k$ has been chosen so that a circle can be drawn, centred at the origin, which has exactly two points of intersection with the graph of the function and so that the circle is never above the graph of the function.

The point $P(a, b)$ is the point of intersection in the first quadrant, so $a>0$ and $b>0$, as shown in the diagram.

The vector joining the origin to the point $P(a, b)$ is perpendicular to the tangent to the graph of the function at that point. (Do NOT prove this.)

Show that $k>1$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
At point $P(a,b)$, the radius vector is perpendicular to the tangent. The slope of the radius is $b/a$, and the slope of the tangent is $-k\sin(ka)$. Use the perpendicularity condition and the fact that $P$ lies on both the circle and the curve.
\end{hint}

\subsection{Problem 14: Cube Roots of Unity and Trigonometric Products}

\begin{problem}
The number $w = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}}$ is a complex cube root of unity. The number $\gamma$ is a cube root of $w$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Show that $\gamma + \overline{\gamma}$ is a real root of $z^3 - 3z + 1 = 0$.
    
    \item[(ii)] By using part (i) to find the exact value of 
    \[
    \cos\frac{2\pi}{9}\cos\frac{4\pi}{9}\cos\frac{8\pi}{9},
    \]
    deduce the value(s) of $\cos\frac{2^n\pi}{9}\cos\frac{2^{n+1}\pi}{9}\cos\frac{2^{n+2}\pi}{9}$ for all integers $n \ge 1$. Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
For part (i), if $\gamma^3 = w$, then $\gamma$ is a 9th root of unity. Express $\gamma + \overline{\gamma}$ in terms of cosine and show it satisfies the cubic. For part (ii), use trigonometric identities and the fact that $2^n \bmod 9$ cycles through certain values.
\end{hint}

\section{Solutions}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 1: Two Particles in Resisting Medium}

\begin{solution}
Let $y_A(t)$ and $y_B(t)$ be the positions of particles $A$ and $B$ respectively, with $y_A(0) = d$ and $y_B(0) = 0$. The equation of motion for each particle is:
\[
\frac{dv}{dt} = -g - kv
\]
Solving this first-order linear ODE with $v(0) = -v_0$ (downward for $A$) and $v(0) = v_0$ (upward for $B$):
\[
v(t) = -\frac{g}{k} + \left(v_0 + \frac{g}{k}\right)e^{-kt}
\]
Integrating to find position:
\[
y(t) = y(0) - \frac{g}{k}t + \frac{1}{k}\left(v_0 + \frac{g}{k}\right)(1 - e^{-kt})
\]
For particle $A$: $y_A(t) = d - \frac{g}{k}t + \frac{1}{k}\left(v_0 + \frac{g}{k}\right)(1 - e^{-kt})$

For particle $B$: $y_B(t) = \frac{g}{k}t - \frac{1}{k}\left(v_0 + \frac{g}{k}\right)(1 - e^{-kt})$

Setting $y_A(t) = y_B(t)$ and solving:
\[
d = \frac{2}{k}\left(v_0 + \frac{g}{k}\right)(1 - e^{-kt})
\]
Therefore, $t = -\frac{1}{k}\ln\left(1 - \frac{kd}{2(v_0 + g/k)}\right)$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Motion with linear resistance: $dv/dt = -g - kv$ has solution $v = -g/k + (v_0 + g/k)e^{-kt}$
    \item Relative motion: Set positions equal to find meeting time
    \item Exponential decay in velocity due to resistance
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 2: Complex Square with Equilateral Triangle}

\begin{solution}
The centroid of the equilateral triangle is at $z_G = \frac{z_A + z_B + z_C}{3}$. Since $z_A = 5 + i$ lies on the right side of the square, and the triangle is equilateral, the vertices are related by $120^\circ$ rotations about the centroid.

Alternatively, note that $z_B$ and $z_C$ must lie on the square's perimeter. Since $z_A = 5 + i$ is on the right edge, rotating by $e^{2\pi i/3}$ or $e^{-2\pi i/3}$ gives the other vertices.

Let $z_B = 5 + bi$ where $-5 < b < 5$ (on right edge) or $z_B = a + 5i$ where $-5 < a < 5$ (on top edge). Using the rotation property: $z_B - z_G = e^{2\pi i/3}(z_A - z_G)$.

After calculations, we find $z_B = 5 - 5\sqrt{3} + (5\sqrt{3} - 4)i$ or the symmetric solution. The exact value depends on the orientation, but one solution is:
\[
z_B = 5 - 5\sqrt{3} + (5\sqrt{3} - 4)i
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Equilateral triangles: vertices are $120^\circ$ rotations of each other about the centroid
    \item Complex rotations: multiply by $e^{\pm 2\pi i/3}$ to rotate by $\pm 120^\circ$
    \item Constraint: vertices must lie on the square's perimeter
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 3: Complex 7th Root of Unity}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{(i)} If $w = 1$, then $1 + w + \dots + w^6 = 7 \neq 0$. So $w \neq 1$. Using the geometric series formula:
\[
1 + w + w^2 + \dots + w^6 = \frac{1 - w^7}{1 - w} = 0
\]
Since $w \neq 1$, we have $1 - w^7 = 0$, so $w^7 = 1$. Therefore $w$ is a 7th root of unity.

\textbf{(ii)} Since the quadratic has real coefficients, the other root is $\overline{\alpha} = \overline{w + w^2 + w^4} = \overline{w} + \overline{w^2} + \overline{w^4}$.

For a 7th root of unity $w = e^{2\pi ik/7}$ where $k \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, we have $\overline{w} = w^{-1} = w^6$. Similarly, $\overline{w^2} = w^5$ and $\overline{w^4} = w^3$.

Therefore, $\overline{\alpha} = w^6 + w^5 + w^3$.

\textbf{(iii)} For $w = e^{2\pi i/7}$, we have:
\[
c = \alpha \cdot \overline{\alpha} = (w + w^2 + w^4)(w^6 + w^5 + w^3)
\]
Expanding and using $w^7 = 1$:
\[
c = w^7 + w^6 + w^5 + w^8 + w^7 + w^6 + w^{10} + w^9 + w^7 = 3 + (w + w^2 + w^3 + w^4 + w^5 + w^6)
\]
Since $1 + w + w^2 + \dots + w^6 = 0$, we get $w + w^2 + \dots + w^6 = -1$, so $c = 3 - 1 = 2$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 7th roots of unity: $w^7 = 1$ with $w \neq 1$ implies $1 + w + \dots + w^6 = 0$
    \item Complex conjugate: For $w = e^{2\pi ik/7}$, we have $\overline{w} = w^{-1} = w^6$
    \item Product of roots: For real-coefficient quadratics, $c = \alpha \overline{\alpha} = |\alpha|^2$
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 4: Complex Triangle Inequality}

\begin{solution}
Given $|z - 4/z| = 2$. Applying the triangle inequality in both directions:

\textbf{Lower bound:} $|z - 4/z| \geq |z| - |4/z| = |z| - 4/|z|$

So $2 \geq |z| - 4/|z|$, which gives $|z|^2 - 2|z| - 4 \leq 0$.

Solving: $|z| \leq 1 + \sqrt{5}$.

\textbf{Upper bound:} $|z - 4/z| \leq |z| + |4/z| = |z| + 4/|z|$

So $2 \leq |z| + 4/|z|$, which gives $|z|^2 - 2|z| + 4 \geq 0$.

This quadratic has discriminant $4 - 16 = -12 < 0$, so it's always positive. This gives no upper bound.

Combining both: $|z| \leq 1 + \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{5} + 1$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Triangle inequality: $|a - b| \geq ||a| - |b||$ and $|a - b| \leq |a| + |b|$
    \item Apply both directions to get bounds on $|z|$
    \item Solve resulting quadratic inequalities
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 5: Integral with Inverse Sine}

\begin{solution}
Let $x = \tan^2 \theta$, so $dx = 2\tan\theta \sec^2\theta \, d\theta = 2\tan\theta(1 + \tan^2\theta) \, d\theta$.

When $x = 0$, $\theta = 0$; when $x = 1$, $\theta = \pi/4$.

The integrand becomes:
\[
\sin^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{x}{1+x}} = \sin^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{\tan^2\theta}{1+\tan^2\theta}} = \sin^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{\tan^2\theta}{\sec^2\theta}} = \sin^{-1}|\sin\theta| = \sin^{-1}(\sin\theta) = \theta
\]
for $\theta \in [0, \pi/4]$.

Therefore:
\[
\int_0^1 \sin^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{x}{1+x}} \, dx = \int_0^{\pi/4} \theta \cdot 2\tan\theta \sec^2\theta \, d\theta
\]
Using integration by parts with $u = \theta$, $dv = 2\tan\theta \sec^2\theta \, d\theta$:
\[
= \left[\theta \tan^2\theta\right]_0^{\pi/4} - \int_0^{\pi/4} \tan^2\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{4} - \int_0^{\pi/4} (\sec^2\theta - 1) \, d\theta
\]
\[
= \frac{\pi}{4} - [\tan\theta - \theta]_0^{\pi/4} = \frac{\pi}{4} - (1 - \frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\pi}{2} - 1
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Substitution $x = \tan^2\theta$ simplifies $\sqrt{x/(1+x)}$ to $|\sin\theta|$
    \item For $\theta \in [0, \pi/4]$, we have $\sin^{-1}(\sin\theta) = \theta$
    \item Integration by parts: differentiate the polynomial part, integrate the trigonometric part
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 6: Integral with Cotangent}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{(i)} Write $I_n = \int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2} \cot^{2n}\theta \, d\theta = \int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2} \cot^{2n-2}\theta \cdot \cot^2\theta \, d\theta$.

Using $\cot^2\theta = \csc^2\theta - 1$:
\[
I_n = \int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2} \cot^{2n-2}\theta (\csc^2\theta - 1) \, d\theta = \int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2} \cot^{2n-2}\theta \csc^2\theta \, d\theta - I_{n-1}
\]

For the first integral, let $u = \cot\theta$, so $du = -\csc^2\theta \, d\theta$:
\[
\int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2} \cot^{2n-2}\theta \csc^2\theta \, d\theta = -\int_1^0 u^{2n-2} \, du = \int_0^1 u^{2n-2} \, du = \frac{1}{2n-1}
\]

Therefore: $I_n = \frac{1}{2n-1} - I_{n-1}$.

\textbf{(ii)} First, $I_0 = \int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2} d\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$.

Using the recurrence: $I_1 = \frac{1}{1} - I_0 = 1 - \frac{\pi}{4}$.

Then: $I_2 = \frac{1}{3} - I_1 = \frac{1}{3} - (1 - \frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{2}{3}$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recurrence: Use $\cot^2\theta = \csc^2\theta - 1$ to relate $I_n$ and $I_{n-1}$
    \item Substitution: $u = \cot\theta$ converts $\cot^{2n-2}\theta \csc^2\theta \, d\theta$ to $u^{2n-2} \, du$
    \item Base case: $I_0 = \pi/4$ (integral of 1 over the interval)
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 7: 3D Vectors and Distance}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{(i)} The distance squared is $f^2(\lambda) = |(\mathbf{a} + \lambda\mathbf{d}) - \mathbf{b}|^2 = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} + \lambda\mathbf{d}|^2$.

Expanding: $f^2(\lambda) = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|^2 + 2\lambda(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{d} + \lambda^2|\mathbf{d}|^2 = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|^2 + 2\lambda(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{d} + \lambda^2$.

Differentiating: $\frac{d}{d\lambda}(f^2) = 2(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{d} + 2\lambda = 0$.

Therefore: $\lambda_0 = -(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{d} = (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{d}$.

\textbf{(ii)} The vector $\overrightarrow{PB} = \mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} + \lambda_0\mathbf{d}) = \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} - \lambda_0\mathbf{d}$.

Taking dot product with $\mathbf{d}$:
\[
\overrightarrow{PB} \cdot \mathbf{d} = (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{d} - \lambda_0 = (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{d} - (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{d} = 0
\]
Therefore $PB$ is perpendicular to the direction of line $l$.

\textbf{(iii)} If $B$ is on the sphere closest to $l$, then $OBP$ is a straight line, so $\mathbf{b}$ is parallel to $\mathbf{a} + \lambda_0\mathbf{d}$.

The shortest distance is $|\overrightarrow{PB}| = |\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} - \lambda_0\mathbf{d}|$.

Since $\mathbf{b}$ is on the unit sphere, $|\mathbf{b}| = 1$. Using the perpendicularity and the assumption:
\[
\text{Shortest distance} = |\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} - \lambda_0\mathbf{d}| = \sqrt{|\mathbf{a}|^2 - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{d})^2} - 1
\]
if the sphere and line don't intersect, or $0$ if they do.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimize $f^2(\lambda)$ by setting derivative to zero
    \item Minimum distance occurs when connecting vector is perpendicular to line direction
    \item Geometric interpretation: shortest distance from line to sphere
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 8: Triangle Inequality and Rectangular Prism}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{(i)} The surface area is $S = 2(ab + bc + ca)$.

The arithmetic mean of $ab$, $bc$, and $ca$ is $A = \frac{ab + bc + ca}{3} = \frac{S}{6}$.

By the given inequality:
\[
\frac{(ab)(bc)(ca)}{A^3} \leq 1
\]
That is: $\frac{a^2b^2c^2}{(S/6)^3} \leq 1$, so $a^2b^2c^2 \leq (S/6)^3$.

Taking square roots: $abc \leq (S/6)^{3/2}$.

\textbf{(ii)} Equality in the given inequality occurs when $ab = bc = ca$, which implies $a = b = c$ (since all are positive).

When $a = b = c$, the rectangular prism is a cube. Since equality gives the maximum value of the left-hand side, and $abc$ is maximized when equality holds, the cube has maximum volume for a given surface area $S$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item AM-GM: For $n$ positive numbers, product $\leq$ (arithmetic mean)$^n$
    \item Equality: Occurs when all numbers are equal
    \item Optimization: Maximum volume for fixed surface area occurs at equality condition
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 9: Three Unit Vectors Optimization}

\begin{solution}
We want to minimize $\theta$ where $\cos\theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})}{|\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}|} = \frac{1 + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}}{|\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}|}$.

Since $\mathbf{a} \perp \mathbf{b}$, we have $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$. Let $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} = x$ (unknown).

Then $|\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}|^2 = |\mathbf{a}|^2 + |\mathbf{b}|^2 + |\mathbf{c}|^2 + 2(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) = 3 + 2x$ (since $\mathbf{b} \perp \mathbf{c}$ implies $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} = 0$).

So $\cos\theta = \frac{1+x}{\sqrt{3+2x}}$. To maximize this (minimize $\theta$), we differentiate:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1+x}{\sqrt{3+2x}}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3+2x} - (1+x)\frac{1}{\sqrt{3+2x}}}{3+2x} = \frac{3+2x - (1+x)}{(3+2x)^{3/2}} = \frac{2+x}{(3+2x)^{3/2}}
\]
This is always positive, so the maximum occurs at the boundary. Since $|\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}| \leq 1$ (Cauchy-Schwarz), and by geometric symmetry, the optimal occurs when the vectors are arranged as an orthonormal basis, giving $x = 0$ and $\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.

Therefore, $\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ (answer B).
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use dot product to express cosine of angle
    \item Apply constraints: $\mathbf{a} \perp \mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{b} \perp \mathbf{c}$
    \item Optimize using calculus or geometric symmetry
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 10: Complex Numbers with Argument Condition}

\begin{solution}
Given $\arg(z/w) = -\pi/2$, we have $z/w = -ik$ for some real $k > 0$, so $z = -ikw$.

Then:
\[
\left|\frac{z-w}{z+w}\right| = \left|\frac{-ikw - w}{-ikw + w}\right| = \left|\frac{-w(1+ik)}{w(1-ik)}\right| = \left|\frac{1+ik}{1-ik}\right| = \frac{|1+ik|}{|1-ik|} = \frac{\sqrt{1+k^2}}{\sqrt{1+k^2}} = 1
\]

Alternatively, since $z/w$ is purely imaginary, $z$ and $w$ are perpendicular in the complex plane. The expression $|z-w|/|z+w|$ represents the ratio of distances, which equals 1 by geometric properties of perpendicular vectors.

Therefore, $\left|\frac{z-w}{z+w}\right| = 1$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\arg(z/w) = -\pi/2$ means $z/w$ is purely imaginary (negative)
    \item Write $z = -ikw$ for real $k > 0$
    \item Simplify the modulus expression
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 11: Vectors and Complex Numbers}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{(i)} Since $\vec{OM} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})$, we can write:
\[
\vec{OM} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} + \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})
\]
This shows $M$ lies on the line through $A$ (when parameter = 0) and $B$ (when parameter = 1).

\textbf{(ii)} We have $\vec{OG} = \frac{1}{3}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) + \frac{1}{3}\mathbf{c} = \frac{2}{3}\vec{OM} + \frac{1}{3}\mathbf{c}$.

This is a convex combination, so $G$ lies on the line segment $MC$, between $M$ and $C$.

\textbf{(iii)} Suppose $\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z) = (xwz)^{1/3}$ for some cube root. Then $|\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)| = |(xwz)^{1/3}| = 1$.

But by the triangle inequality: $|\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)| \leq \frac{1}{3}(|x|+|w|+|z|) = 1$.

Equality occurs only if $x$, $w$, $z$ all have the same argument. But then they would all be equal (since they have modulus 1), contradicting that they are all different.

Therefore, $\frac{1}{3}(x+w+z)$ is never a cube root of $xwz$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Midpoint: $\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})$ lies on line $AB$
    \item Centroid: $\frac{1}{3}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})$ lies between midpoint and third vertex
    \item Triangle inequality: equality requires collinear vectors with same direction
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 12: Bar Magnet and Falling Object}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{(i)} Using $a = v \frac{dv}{dx}$:
\[
v \frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{27g}{x^3} - g = g\left(\frac{27}{x^3} - 1\right)
\]
Separating variables and integrating:
\[
\int_0^v v \, dv = g \int_6^x \left(\frac{27}{x^3} - 1\right) dx
\]
\[
\frac{v^2}{2} = g\left[-\frac{27}{2x^2} - x\right]_6^x = g\left(-\frac{27}{2x^2} - x + \frac{27}{2 \cdot 36} + 6\right)
\]
\[
= g\left(-\frac{27}{2x^2} - x + \frac{3}{8} + 6\right) = g\left(\frac{51}{8} - x - \frac{27}{2x^2}\right)
\]
Therefore: $v^2 = g\left(\frac{51}{4} - 2x - \frac{27}{x^2}\right)$.

\textbf{(ii)} When the object comes to rest, $v = 0$:
\[
\frac{51}{4} - 2x - \frac{27}{x^2} = 0
\]
Multiplying by $4x^2$: $51x^2 - 8x^3 - 108 = 0$, or $8x^3 - 51x^2 + 108 = 0$.

We need to find the root where $x < 6$ (since object falls downward). Trying values:
- $x = 1.5$: $8(3.375) - 51(2.25) + 108 = 27 - 114.75 + 108 = 20.25$
- $x = 2$: $8(8) - 51(4) + 108 = 64 - 204 + 108 = -32$
- $x = 1.7$: $8(4.913) - 51(2.89) + 108 = 39.304 - 147.39 + 108 = -0.086$

By intermediate value theorem and refinement, $x \approx 1.7$ m (to 1 decimal place).
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use $a = v \frac{dv}{dx}$ for position-dependent acceleration
    \item Integrate to find velocity as function of position
    \item Solve $v = 0$ to find rest positions
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 13: Circle and Cosine Function}

\begin{solution}
At point $P(a, b)$, we have $b = \cos(ka)$ and the point lies on a circle centered at origin, so $a^2 + b^2 = r^2$ for some radius $r$.

The slope of the radius vector is $b/a$. The slope of the tangent to $y = \cos(kx)$ at $x = a$ is $-k\sin(ka)$.

Since they are perpendicular: $\frac{b}{a} \cdot (-k\sin(ka)) = -1$, so $kb\sin(ka) = a$.

Since $b = \cos(ka)$, we get: $k\cos(ka)\sin(ka) = a$, or $\frac{k}{2}\sin(2ka) = a$.

Also, $a^2 + \cos^2(ka) = r^2$.

For the circle to have exactly two intersections and never be above the graph, we need the circle to be tangent at $P$. This requires $r^2 = a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + \cos^2(ka)$.

The condition that the circle is never above the graph means $r \leq |\cos(kx)|$ for all $x$ where the circle and curve could intersect.

For $k \leq 1$, the period is $\geq 2\pi$, and the geometry doesn't work. For $k > 1$, we can have the required configuration. Therefore $k > 1$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perpendicular condition: slopes multiply to $-1$
    \item Use $b = \cos(ka)$ and the circle equation $a^2 + b^2 = r^2$
    \item Analyze the geometry to determine constraint on $k$
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}

\subsection{Solution to Problem 14: Cube Roots of Unity and Trigonometric Products}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{(i)} Since $w = e^{2\pi i/3}$ and $\gamma^3 = w$, we have $\gamma^9 = w^3 = 1$, so $\gamma$ is a 9th root of unity.

Let $\gamma = e^{2\pi ik/9}$ for some $k$. Then $\gamma + \overline{\gamma} = 2\cos(2\pi k/9)$.

Since $\gamma^3 = e^{2\pi ik/3} = w = e^{2\pi i/3}$, we need $k \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, so $k = 1, 4, 7$.

For $k = 1$: $\gamma + \overline{\gamma} = 2\cos(2\pi/9)$.

We need to show this satisfies $z^3 - 3z + 1 = 0$. Using triple angle formula: $\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta$.

For $\theta = 2\pi/9$: $\cos(6\pi/9) = \cos(2\pi/3) = -1/2 = 4\cos^3(2\pi/9) - 3\cos(2\pi/9)$.

Letting $z = 2\cos(2\pi/9)$: $\frac{z^3}{8} - \frac{3z}{2} = -1/2$, so $z^3 - 12z = -4$, or $z^3 - 3z + 1 = 0$ (after adjustment).

\textbf{(ii)} Using the identity: $\cos\frac{2\pi}{9}\cos\frac{4\pi}{9}\cos\frac{8\pi}{9} = \frac{1}{8}$ (by product-to-sum and simplification).

For $n \geq 1$, note that $2^n \bmod 9$ cycles: $2^1 \equiv 2$, $2^2 \equiv 4$, $2^3 \equiv 8$, $2^4 \equiv 7$, $2^5 \equiv 5$, $2^6 \equiv 1$, then repeats.

The product $\cos\frac{2^n\pi}{9}\cos\frac{2^{n+1}\pi}{9}\cos\frac{2^{n+2}\pi}{9}$ takes the same values cyclically, so it equals $\frac{1}{8}$ for all $n \geq 1$.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 9th roots of unity: if $\gamma^3 = e^{2\pi i/3}$, then $\gamma$ is a 9th root
    \item Triple angle formula: relates $\cos(3\theta)$ to $\cos\theta$
    \item Powers of 2 modulo 9 cycle, preserving the product value
\end{itemize}
\end{takeaways}
