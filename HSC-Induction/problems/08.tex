\begin{problem}[Bounding sums of cubes]
Prove that for every integer $n\ge2$,
\[
\sum_{r=1}^{n-1} r^3 < \frac{n^4}{4} < \sum_{r=1}^n r^3.
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Check the base case $n=2$ explicitly.
  \item For the inductive step compare the difference between $\dfrac{(k+1)^4}{4}$ and $\dfrac{k^4}{4}$ with $k^3$ and $(k+1)^3$ as needed.
  \item Use the binomial expansion of $(k+1)^4$ to rearrange terms.
\end{enumerate}
\end{hint}

\begin{solution}
Base case $n=2$: $1 = \sum_{r=1}^{1} r^3 < 4 = \tfrac{2^4}{4} < 1+8=9$. Assume the double inequality holds for $n=k\ge2$. Then
\[\frac{(k+1)^4}{4} = \frac{k^4}{4} + k^3 + \frac{6k^2+4k+1}{4}.
\]
Since the extra term $\tfrac{6k^2+4k+1}{4}>0$, we have $\tfrac{(k+1)^4}{4} > \tfrac{k^4}{4}+k^3$, and by the inductive hypothesis $\tfrac{k^4}{4}+k^3>\sum_{r=1}^k r^3$. Thus the left inequality for $k+1$ holds. For the right inequality, compare $\tfrac{(k+1)^4}{4}$ with $\tfrac{k^4}{4}+(k+1)^3$ and observe the difference equals $\tfrac{6k^2+8k+3}{4}>0$, giving the required result.
\end{solution}

\begin{takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
%   \item Bounding sums using polynomial expansions and termwise comparison is a standard induction strategy for inequalities.
  \item Verify base cases carefully when working with strict inequalities.
  \item \textbf{Bounding Sums:} This technique proves that a sum of cubes is bounded by the integral of $x^3$.
  \item \textbf{Algebraic Dominance:} In inequality induction, the goal is often to show that the "added part" of the function grows faster or slower than the "added part" of the sum.
\end{itemize}
