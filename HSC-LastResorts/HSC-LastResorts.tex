\section{Fundamentals Review}

\subsection{Key Inequalities}
Problem~16 frequently employs fundamental inequalities as building blocks for more complex arguments.

\subsubsection{Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality}
\begin{theorem}[AM-GM Inequality]
For positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$:
\[\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}\]
Equality occurs if and only if $a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Weighted AM-GM Inequality]
For positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and positive weights $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ with $w_1 + w_2 + \cdots + w_n = 1$:
\[w_1 a_1 + w_2 a_2 + \cdots + w_n a_n \geq a_1^{w_1} a_2^{w_2} \cdots a_n^{w_n}\]
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality}
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality]
For vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$:
\[|\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}| \leq |\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}|\]
Equivalently, for real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$:
\[\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^2\right)\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Complex Number Theory}
\subsubsection{De Moivre's Theorem}
\begin{theorem}[De Moivre's Theorem]
For complex numbers in polar form $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$:
\[z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))\]
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Roots of Unity}
\begin{theorem}[Roots of Unity]
The $n$th roots of unity are given by:
\[\omega_k = e^{2\pi i k/n} = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\]
for $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Vector Algebra}
\subsubsection{Dot Product}
For vectors $\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$:
\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3 = |\mathbf{u}||\mathbf{v}|\cos\theta\]

\subsubsection{Cross Product}
\[\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix}\]
The magnitude $|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}| = |\mathbf{u}||\mathbf{v}|\sin\theta$ equals the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$.

\subsection{Polynomial Theory}
\subsubsection{Newton's Identities}
\begin{theorem}[Newton's Identities]
For a polynomial with roots $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n$, if $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^k$ and $e_k$ are the elementary symmetric polynomials, then:
\[S_k - e_1 S_{k-1} + e_2 S_{k-2} - \cdots + (-1)^{k-1} e_{k-1} S_1 + (-1)^k k e_k = 0\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Chebyshev Polynomials (First Kind)}
The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind $T_n(x)$ are a family of orthogonal polynomials on $[-1,1]$ with the defining trigonometric identity:
\[ T_n(x) = \cos\big(n\arccos x\big). \]

\subsubsection{Recurrence Formula}
They satisfy the three-term recurrence for $n\ge 1$:
\[ T_{n+1}(x) = 2x\,T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x), \quad T_0(x)=1,\; T_1(x)=x. \]

\subsubsection{Explicit Low-Degree Polynomials}
\[ T_0(x) = 1, \quad T_1(x) = x, \quad T_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1, \quad T_3(x) = 4x^3 - 3x. \]

These identities are frequently useful for transforming certain cubic equations by matching the structure of $T_3(x)$.

\subsection{Chebyshev Polynomials (Second Kind)}
The Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind $U_n(x)$ form another family of orthogonal polynomials on $[-1,1]$, closely related to the first kind. They are defined by the trigonometric identity:
\[ U_n(x) = \frac{\sin\big((n+1)\arccos x\big)}{\sin(\arccos x)}. \]

Equivalently, if $x = \cos\theta$, then:
\[ U_n(\cos\theta) = \frac{\sin((n+1)\theta)}{\sin\theta}. \]

\subsubsection{Recurrence Formula}
The second kind Chebyshev polynomials satisfy the same three-term recurrence as the first kind, but with different initial conditions:
\[ U_{n+1}(x) = 2x\,U_n(x) - U_{n-1}(x), \quad U_0(x)=1,\; U_1(x)=2x. \]

\subsubsection{Explicit Low-Degree Polynomials}
\[ U_0(x) = 1, \quad U_1(x) = 2x, \quad U_2(x) = 4x^2 - 1, \quad U_3(x) = 8x^3 - 4x. \]

\subsubsection{Relationship to First Kind}
The Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind are related by:
\[ U_n(x) = \frac{T'_{n+1}(x)}{n+1}, \quad T_n(x) = U_n(x) - x\,U_{n-1}(x). \]

Additionally, they satisfy:
\[ T_n(x) = \cos(n\arccos x) \quad \text{and} \quad U_n(x) = \frac{\sin((n+1)\arccos x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}. \]

\subsubsection{Key Properties}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  % \item Both $T_n$ and $U_n$ are orthogonal polynomials on $[-1,1]$ with respect to different weight functions.
  \item $T_n(x)$ has the minimal leading coefficient among all monic polynomials of degree $n$ bounded by 1 on $[-1,1]$.
  \item The zeros of $U_n(x)$ are simple and lie in the interior of $(-1,1)$.
  \item Both families play a crucial role in approximation theory and the study of polynomial bounds.
\end{itemize}

These polynomials appear frequently in Problem~16 when dealing with bounded polynomial coefficients and optimal approximations.

\subsection{Optimization Techniques}

\subsubsection{Lagrange Multipliers (Conceptual)}

\begin{definition}[Method of Lagrange Multipliers]
To optimize a function $f(x,y,z)$ subject to a constraint $g(x,y,z) = 0$, look for points where:
\[\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\]

Here, $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ are the gradients of $f$ and $g$, respectively, 
and $\lambda$ is a scalar known as the Lagrange multiplier.

The gradient of a function $f$ is the vector of its partial derivatives:
\[\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right)\]

\end{definition}

In HSC problems, this often reduces to applying AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities.

\textbf{Note:} This technique is not covered at HSC level but is useful attacking hard problems (and for university studies as well).

Here is how you could use it to attack the problems:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Guess when the max/min occurs: Use the condition $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$ to solve for the variables (often resulting in $x=y=z$ for symmetric expressions).
  \item Identify the "Target Inequality": Once you know the values that achieve the optimum (e.g., $x=2, y=2$), you know exactly what the right-hand side of your inequality should look like.
  \item Reverse-engineer the formal proof: Work backward from that optimum using standard HSC tools—most commonly by setting up AM-GM terms or choosing the vectors for Cauchy-Schwarz that align with your discovered ratios.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Constrained Optimization on an Ellipse]
Find the maximum value of $f(x,y) = x + y$ subject to the constraint $2x^2 + 3y^2 = 1$.

\textbf{Solution:}
Let $f(x,y) = x + y$ and $g(x,y) = 2x^2 + 3y^2 - 1 = 0$.
The Lagrange multiplier condition $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$ gives:
\begin{align*}
1 &= 4\lambda x \implies x = \frac{1}{4\lambda} \\
1 &= 6\lambda y \implies y = \frac{1}{6\lambda}
\end{align*}
From these, $y = \frac{2}{3}x$. Substituting into the constraint:
\[2x^2 + 3\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)^2 = 1 \implies \frac{10}{3}x^2 = 1 \implies x = \sqrt{\frac{3}{10}}\]
Then $y = \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{\frac{3}{10}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{30}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{15}}$.
The maximum value is $f_{\max} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{10}} + \sqrt{\frac{2}{15}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}$.

\textit{Connection to HSC:} This identifies the correct vectors for Cauchy-Schwarz: $(\sqrt{2}x, \sqrt{3}y) \cdot (1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{3})$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Proving AM-GM Type Inequalities]
Maximize the product $xyz$ for $x, y, z > 0$ subject to $x + y + z = k$ (where $k$ is a constant).

\textbf{Solution:}
Let $f(x,y,z) = xyz$ and $g(x,y,z) = x + y + z - k = 0$.
The condition $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$ gives:
\[(yz, xz, xy) = \lambda(1, 1, 1)\]
This implies $yz = xz = xy$, so $x = y = z$ (since all are positive).
Substituting into the constraint: $3x = k \implies x = k/3$.
The maximum value of the product is $(k/3)^3 = k^3/27$.

This confirms that for any fixed sum, the product is maximized when the terms are equal, which is the geometric intuition behind AM-GM: $\frac{x+y+z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz}$.
\end{example}

\subsection{The Big O Notation}
\subsubsection{What is Big O?}
The Big O notation is a mathematical tool used to describe the behavior of functions as their input approaches a particular value (often infinity or zero). It provides a way to express approximations and compare the growth rates of functions.

\begin{definition}[Big O Notation]
For functions $f$ and $g$, we write $f(x) = O(g(x))$ as $x \to a$ if there exist constants $C > 0$ and $\delta > 0$ such that 
\[|f(x)| \leq C|g(x)|\]
for all $x$ near $a$.

Informally, this means $f(x)$ grows no faster than $g(x)$ near $a$.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Important Note for HSC Students}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Big O notation is \textbf{NOT} covered in the HSC/NESA syllabus
  \item It is \textbf{NOT required} for HSC examinations
  \item \textbf{NOT recommended} to use or mention in HSC assessments or exams
  \item However, keep it as your \textbf{``secret weapon''} for Extension 2! It can help you:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Find limits quickly by identifying dominant terms
    \item Approximate expressions efficiently
    \item Understand the behavior of complex expressions
  \end{itemize}
  \item Excellent preparation for university mathematics and further studies
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Applications}
Big O notation is particularly useful for:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Approximating functions:} Understanding which terms dominate as $x$ becomes large or small
  \item \textbf{Finding limits:} Identifying the leading behavior to evaluate challenging limits
  \item \textbf{Sequences of numbers:} Describing how sequences grow or decay
  \item \textbf{Functions:} Comparing growth rates of different functions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Common Examples}
Here are some fundamental approximations using Big O notation:

\textbf{Exponential Function:}
\[e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + O(x^4) \quad \text{as } x \to 0\]

\textbf{Natural Logarithm:}
\[\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + O(x^5) \quad \text{as } x \to 0\]

\textbf{Sine Function:}
\[\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + O(x^7) \quad \text{as } x \to 0\]

\textbf{Cosine Function:}
\[\cos(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + O(x^6) \quad \text{as } x \to 0\]

\subsubsection{Practical Examples: The "Secret Weapon" in Action}

% \textbf{Example 1: Avoiding the L'Hopital Marathon}

\begin{example}[Avoiding the L'Hopital Marathon]
Consider the classic limit:
\[ L = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x - \sin(x)}{x^3} \]
\textit{The Hard Way:} Applying L'Hopital's Rule three separate times until the $x^3$ vanishes.
\textit{The Big O Way:} Substitute $\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^5)$.
\begin{align*}
    \frac{x - \sin(x)}{x^3} &= \frac{x - \left(x - \frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^5)\right)}{x^3} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{x^3}{6} - O(x^5)}{x^3} \\
    &= \frac{1}{6} - O(x^2)
\end{align*}
As $x \to 0$, the term $O(x^2) \to 0$. Thus, $L = \frac{1}{6}$.
\end{example}

\vspace{1em}

\begin{example}[Mixed Function Simplification]

Evaluate the limit involving both Logarithms and Trigonometry:
\[ L = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1+x) - \sin(x) + \frac{1}{2}x^2}{x^3} \]
\textit{The Hard Way:} Differentiating this repeatedly is messy due to the quotient and chain rules.
\textit{The Big O Way:} Use the known expansions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} + O(x^4)$
    \item $\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^5)$
\end{itemize}
Substitute these into the numerator:
\begin{align*}
    \text{Num} &= \left(x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} + \dots\right) - \left(x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \dots\right) + \frac{x^2}{2} \\
    &= \left(x - x\right) + \left(-\frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{x^3}{3} - (-\frac{x^3}{6})\right) + O(x^4) \\
    &= \frac{3x^3}{6} + O(x^4) = \frac{1}{2}x^3 + O(x^4)
\end{align*}
Now, divide by the denominator $x^3$:
\[ L = \lim_{x \to 0} \left( \frac{1}{2} + O(x) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \]
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Connection with Taylor Series}
The Big O notation naturally connects with Taylor series expansions. The Taylor series represents a function as an infinite sum of terms calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point. The $O(x^n)$ term represents all the remaining terms of order $n$ and higher, giving us a precise way to express truncation error.

For example, when we write $e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + O(x^3)$, we're saying that the error in approximating $e^x$ by $1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2}$ behaves like $x^3$ for small $x$.
