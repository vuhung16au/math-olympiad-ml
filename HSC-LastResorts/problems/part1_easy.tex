\section*{Problem 2}
From samples/02.tex

(a) Given positive real numbers $p$ and $q$, show that:
\[ 2p + q \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{p^2 q} \]

(b) A closed cylindrical can has radius $r$, height $h$, and a fixed Total Surface Area $A$.

\section*{Problem 3}
From samples/03.tex

(a) Let $x, y, z$ be positive real numbers. Prove that:
\[ (x + y + z)\left(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z}\right) \ge 9 \]

(b) A plane passes through the fixed point $P(a, b, c)$ where $a,b,c > 0$. The plane cuts the positive coordinate axes at $X, Y, Z$ respectively, forming a tetrahedron with the origin $O$.

% Problem 5: Vector Inequalities (Ellipsoid)
\section*{Problem 5}
From samples/06.tex

(i) By choosing appropriate vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, find the maximum value of $x + y + z$ for $P(x, y, z)$ on the ellipsoid $\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{9} + \frac{z^2}{25} = 1$.

(ii) Find the coordinates of $P$ in the first octant where this maximum occurs.
