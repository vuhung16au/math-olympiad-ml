% Problem 16
From samples/09.tex
(a) Prove that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$ for $x, y > 0$.
Hint: Use $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
Solution: $(x-y)^2 \geq 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$.
Takeaway: Basic algebraic manipulation is useful for inequalities.

% Problem 17
From samples/10.tex
(a) Show that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq ab + bc + ca$ for $a, b, c > 0$.
Hint: Use the rearrangement inequality.
Solution: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca = \frac{1}{2}[(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2] \geq 0$.
Takeaway: Rearrangement and symmetry help prove inequalities.

% Problem 18
From samples/11.tex
(a) Prove that $x^3 + y^3 \geq xy(x+y)$ for $x, y > 0$.
Hint: Factor and compare terms.
Solution: $x^3 + y^3 - xy(x+y) = x^3 + y^3 - x^2y - xy^2 = (x-y)^2(x+y) \geq 0$.
Takeaway: Factoring is a powerful tool in inequalities.

% Problem 19
From samples/12.tex
(a) Show that $x^4 + y^4 \geq 2x^2y^2$ for $x, y > 0$.
Hint: Use AM-GM on $x^4$ and $y^4$.
Solution: $x^4 + y^4 \geq 2x^2y^2$ by AM-GM.
Takeaway: AM-GM applies to higher powers as well.

% Problem 20
From samples/13.tex
(a) Prove that $x^5 + y^5 \geq 5x^3y^2$ for $x, y > 0$.
Hint: Use induction or AM-GM.
Solution: By AM-GM, $x^5 + y^5 \geq 2(x^5y^5)^{1/2} = 2x^{5/2}y^{5/2}$, which is greater than $5x^3y^2$ for $x, y > 0$.
Takeaway: Induction and AM-GM are useful for higher degree inequalities.

% Problem 21
From samples/14.tex
(a) Show that $a^6 + b^6 + c^6 \geq 3a^2b^2c^2$ for $a, b, c > 0$.
Hint: Use AM-GM for three terms.
Solution: $a^6 + b^6 + c^6 \geq 3(a^6b^6c^6)^{1/3} = 3a^2b^2c^2$.
Takeaway: AM-GM generalizes to any number of terms.
