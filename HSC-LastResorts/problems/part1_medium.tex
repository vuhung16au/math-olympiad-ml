(i) Show that the area of triangle $ABC$ with $A, B, C$ on the axes is $S = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{b^2 c^2 + a^2 c^2 + a^2 b^2}$.

(ii) Let $S_{xy}, S_{yz}, S_{zx}$ be the areas of the projections of $\triangle ABC$ onto the coordinate planes. Prove that $S^2 = S_{xy}^2 + S_{yz}^2 + S_{zx}^2$.

Four unit vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4$ originate from the origin $O$ and their sum is zero. Let $\theta_{ij}$ be the angle between $\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\mathbf{v}_j$. Show that $\sum_{1 \le i < j \le 4} \cos \theta_{ij} = -2$.

\section*{Problem 8}
From samples/09.tex

Find all complex numbers $z_1, z_2, z_3$ that satisfy the following system of equations simultaneously:
\[
\begin{cases}
    z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 3 \\
    z_1^2 + z_2^2 + z_3^2 = 3 \\
    z_1^3 + z_2^3 + z_3^3 = 3
\end{cases}

\section*{Problem 9}
From samples/10.tex

Let $z_1, z_2, z_3$ be distinct complex numbers such that:
\[ |z_1| = |z_2| = |z_3| = 1 \]
\[ z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 1 \]
\[ z_1 z_2 z_3 = 1 \]
Prove that at least one of the complex numbers must be equal to $1$.

% Problem 10: Zero Sum Geometry
\section*{Problem 10}
From samples/11.tex

Three complex numbers $z_1, z_2, z_3$ satisfy:
\[
\begin{cases}
    |z_1| = |z_2| = |z_3| = r & (r > 0) \\
    z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 0
\end{cases}
\]
Show that $z_1, z_2, z_3$ represent the vertices of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle $|z|=r$.
