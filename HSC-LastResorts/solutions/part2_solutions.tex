% Problem 16 Solution
Hint: Use $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
Solution: $(x-y)^2 \geq 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$.
Takeaway: Basic algebraic manipulation is useful for inequalities.

% Problem 17 Solution
Hint: Use the rearrangement inequality.
Solution: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca = \frac{1}{2}[(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2] \geq 0$.
Takeaway: Rearrangement and symmetry help prove inequalities.

% Problem 18 Solution
Hint: Factor and compare terms.
Solution: $x^3 + y^3 - xy(x+y) = (x-y)^2(x+y) \geq 0$.
Takeaway: Factoring is a powerful tool in inequalities.

% Problem 19 Solution
Hint: Use AM-GM on $x^4$ and $y^4$.
Solution: $x^4 + y^4 \geq 2x^2y^2$ by AM-GM.
Takeaway: AM-GM applies to higher powers as well.

% Problem 20 Solution
Hint: Use induction or AM-GM.
Solution: By AM-GM, $x^5 + y^5 \geq 2x^{5/2}y^{5/2}$, which is greater than $5x^3y^2$ for $x, y > 0$.
Takeaway: Induction and AM-GM are useful for higher degree inequalities.

% Problem 21 Solution
Hint: Use AM-GM for three terms.
Solution: $a^6 + b^6 + c^6 \geq 3a^2b^2c^2$ by AM-GM.
Takeaway: AM-GM generalizes to any number of terms.
