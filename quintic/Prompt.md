# Write a Python script to solve the following quintic equation:
\[ x^5 - 5x^3 + 5x - 4 = 0 \]

Addition hints:

- The script should use SymPy to solve the equation.
- The script should print the solutions in radical form.
- The script should print the solutions in numerical form.
- The script should print the solutions in complex form.

# Create a virtual environment for the project.

use python 3.13 
use `uv` as package manager
use `.venv` as the virtual environment name

Install the following dependencies:
- sympy
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
